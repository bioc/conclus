Description: 
    CONCLUS is a tool for robust clustering and positive marker features 
    selection of single-cell RNA-seq (sc-RNA-seq) datasets. It takes advantage 
    of a consensus clustering approach that greatly simplify sc-RNA-seq data 
    analysis for the user. Of note, CONCLUS does not cover the preprocessing 
    steps of sequencing files obtained following next-generation sequencing.
    
    CONCLUS is organized into the following steps:
    
    Generation of multiple t-SNE plots with a range of parameters including 
    different selection of genes extracted from PCA. Use the Density-based 
    spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm for 
    idenfication of clusters in each generated t-SNE plot. All DBSCAN results 
    are combined into a cell similarity matrix. The cell similarity matrix is 
    used to define "CONSENSUS" clusters conserved accross the previously 
    defined clustering solutions. Identify marker genes for each concensus 
    cluster.
